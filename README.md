# Fusionpbx-WEBRTC
WebRTC Dialer for FusionPBX.
A fully featured browser based WebRTC SIP phone for FusionPBX.

*NOTE this is a custom made WebRTC client for Fusionpbx and i have used [Browser-Phone](https://github.com/InnovateAsterisk/Browser-Phone.git) which is a repo of Mr. Conrad de Wet. I have just made changes on the Browser-Phone code and created few php files to make it work with FusionPBX.
